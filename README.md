# Covid-19-Detection from Chest X-Ray (CXR) using Convolutional Neural Network

This repository is for our B. Tech major project. In this project, we are trying to predict whether a person has COVID-19 ,Lung Opacity ,Viral Pneumonia or it is normal from their Chest X-Ray (CXR) scan by image classification using Convolutional Neural Network
