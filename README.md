# Covid-19-Detection from Chest X-Ray (CXR) using Convolutional Neural Network

This repository is for our B.Tech major project. This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for predicting lung diseases from medical images. The CNN is trained on a labeled dataset of lung images to classify the presence of different lung diseases.

In this project, we are trying to predict whether a person has COVID-19 ,Lung Opacity ,Viral Pneumonia or it is normal from their Chest X-Ray (CXR) scan by image classification using Convolutional Neural Network. The tool used for implementation are TensorFlow and Keras.
